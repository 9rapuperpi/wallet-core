Assimil is a French company that has been producing language learning courses since 1929. The company's motto is "You assimilate a language as you assimilated your own when you were a child". The courses are based on the principle of intuitive assimilation, which means that learners acquire the language naturally and gradually through exposure to authentic and varied material. The courses are also known for their humor and cultural insights, which make learning more enjoyable and memorable.
 
Assimil offers courses for over 100 languages, ranging from the most popular ones such as English, Spanish, and German, to the less common ones such as Swahili, Mongolian, and Breton. The courses are available in different formats, such as books, CDs, DVDs, online courses, and mobile apps. The courses are suitable for learners of all ages and levels, from beginners to advanced. The courses can be used independently or in combination with other methods and resources.

You can find more information about Assimil and its products on its official website or on its social media pages.

You can also choose the topics and situations that interest you and that are relevant to your needs. You can use Assimil as your main method of learning or as a complement to other sources of input and practice.
